This document outlines an automated data quality checking and cleaning solution designed for data analysts. It explains the motivation behind automating repetitive data preparation tasks, identifies the key users affected by the problem, and describes the limitations of the current manual approach. The document then defines the desired future state, where datasets are validated and safely cleaned at ingestion through a standardized workflow. It also clarifies the assumptions and constraints under which the solution operates, details the outputs produced (a cleaned dataset and a separate quality report), and describes the tools used to implement the solution. Finally, it highlights the role of the Lovable prototype in demonstrating the user experience and summarizes the expected impact in terms of efficiency, consistency, and trust in analytical data.
